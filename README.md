# Camelot - Custom PDF Data Table Extraction

**Camelot** is a Python library designed to extract tables from both **structured** and **unstructured** PDF documents.

## Features

- **Lattice Mode**: Ideal for extracting **visible tables** with clear cell boundaries (e.g., lines or borders).
- **Stream Mode**: Best for **invisible tables** where data is separated using **spaces** rather than borders.
- **Hybrid Mode**: Combines features of both **lattice** and **stream** for complex tables.
- **Network Mode**: Handles advanced extraction scenarios, adapting to unique PDF structures.

## Usage

Camelot allows flexible extraction tailored to the specific structure and formatting of your PDF. Choose the appropriate mode based on the table's visibility and layout to ensure accurate results.
